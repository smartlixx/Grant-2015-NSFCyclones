\section{Facilities, Equipment and Resources}

In general, all of the offices used by members of the proposed research team will have computers stations with access to internet, as well as phones, printers and copiers. Both Stony Brook University and UC Davis provide IT and administrative support.

\ \\

\noindent Stony Brook University: PI Reed has an academic office with full computer access, internet connection, phone and IT support in the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences at Stony Brook University. Prof. Reed also has access to video conferencing to provide updates and direction to the funded collaborators at UC Davis. In addition, the graduate student will be provided adequate workspace complete with a desk, telephone and internet in the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences. 

\ \\

\noindent UC Davis. Co-PI Ullrich have office space provided at UC Davis, including computers, monitors, high-speed internet and access to printers and copiers. In addition, they have access to group video conferencing in order to communicate with the team at Stony Brook University to discuss research progress.  The UC Davis Graduate Student Researcher will also be provided a desk, telephone, internet, etc.

\ \\

\noindent No equipment is needed for the proposed research, beside computer environments for both the Graduate Student Researchers. Furthermore, access to supercomputers for the proposed model simulations are expected to be supplied by NSF/NCAR through a separate computational resources proposal, pending approval of final computational resources needed.
